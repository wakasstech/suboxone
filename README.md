# Suboxone Treatment Platform (Mern Task Assessment)

I developed the Suboxone Treatment Platform, a web application designed to help healthcare providers efficiently manage and monitor patients undergoing Suboxone treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). This platform integrates mapping functionality, patient management, and treatment tracking into a single, user-friendly interface. This project was part of my assessment, which I completed for submission on GitHub.
